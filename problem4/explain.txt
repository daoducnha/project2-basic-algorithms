The function sort_012:
    args:  input list

    The function starts by initializing three empty arrays: arr_0, arr_1, and arr_2. These arrays will be used to store the elements of the input list based on their values.
    Then, the function iterates over each element
        If the element is equal to 0, it appends the element to arr_0
        If the element is equal to 1, it appends the element to arr_1
        If the element is equal to 2, it appends the element to arr_2
    Finally, the function returns the sorted list rs = arr_0 + arr_1 + arr_2
