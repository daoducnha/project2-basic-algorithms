class RouteTrie: represents a Trie of route
    attribute: root
    functions:
        insert:
            method is used to insert a path and its corresponding handler into the Trie. It starts by initializing a variable current_node to the root of the Trie.
        find:
            method is used to find the handler associated with a given path. It starts by initializing current_sub_path to the root of the Trie
        split_path:
            parse path to array of sub paths
class Router: maintain RouteTrie object
    attribute: route, handler
    functions:
        add_handler:
            method is used to add a handler for a specific path. It starts by initializing current_node to the root of the Trie. It adds the handler to the handler dictionary.
        lookup:
            method is used to find the handler associated with a given path. It splits the path into sub-paths using the split_path method.
        split_path:
                parse path to array of sub paths
